1. Board functions are remaining
    a. initialize_board (V)
    b. is_valid_move(V)
    c. make_move (V)
    d. check_state (V)
    e. print_board (V)
    f. promote_to 
    g. __king_check (V)
    h. __piece_in_path (V)
    i. get_all_possible_moves (V)

2. All pieces are left only (V)
3. En Passant Support
4. Castling for King Support

7. 3fold repetition draw support
8. 50 moves without capture draw support

11. Refactor these function(s): 
    a. def is_valid_matrix_location(self, X, Y): (Used in both pieces and board)
        # Not required currently as we are passing this function pointer instead

12. Refactor variables to make them constant and static in chess (V)
    # Static variables
    COLUMN_LIST = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
    ROW_LIST = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8"]
    PIECE_LIST = ["P", "R", "B", "K", "Q", "N"]
    COLOR_MAP = {
        0:"W",
        1:"B"
    }
13. Refactor piece type as static variable
